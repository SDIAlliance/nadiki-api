  - name: Supported Time Series Metrics for Facilities
    description: |
      The following metrics are supported for streaming time series data. When registering a facility, you will receive the endpoint information as well as labels for Prometheus.
      
      ## Energy Metrics
      - `heatpump_power_consumption_joules`: Heat pump electricity consumption
      - `office_energy_use_joules`: Office electricity consumption
      - `total_generator_energy_joules`: Generator energy output
      - `grid_transformers_energy_joules`: Transformer energy output
      - `onsite_renewable_energy_joules`: On-site renewable energy production
      - `it_power_usage_level1_joules`: IT power at UPS output
      - `it_power_usage_level2_joules`: IT power at PDU output
      - `renewable_energy_certificates_joules`: Green energy certificates
      - `grid_emission_factor_grams`: The current grid emission factor (g/CO2-eq per kWh)
      - `backup_emission_factor_grams`: The current backup power emission factor (g/CO2-eq per kWh)
      - `electricity_source`: 1 for grid; 2 for backup generators
      - `pue_1_ratio`: Power usage effectiveness measured from the output of the UPS systems for IT load
