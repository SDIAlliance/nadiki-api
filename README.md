# Goal

Within Kubernetes, we want to be able to calculate the environmental impact indicators below. 

To do so, we need different entities along the infrastructure to report both static values as well as measured values to a **Central Registry** ('Registar'). From that registry, data can be queried that is needed to calculate the indicators from within Kubernetes.

## Entities

The entities which need to register and report data to the Registrar are the following:

* Data Center Facility
* Rack
* Server

For each entity, there is an API specification which handles the registration. Each entity can pass numerous static parameters with the registration, for most there is default specified (see below). Upon registration each entity receives a Prometheus-compatible endpoint as well as a list of Prometheus metrics & labels that the measured data should be reported to. It is then up to the respective entity to collect & forward the data to the endpoint.
